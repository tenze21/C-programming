# C Programming.
It's been over a year now since I got into computer science and this field never fails to facinate me with the sheer amount of stuff that is out there to learn. By now I have tried my hands on Javascript, GO and Python. While coding with these languages somethings been always bothering me like how I never properly understood how those programming languages did their stuff like I learned that you can assign variables simply like this `let num=3;`(JS code) but I never understood what I was really doing "where was it actually storing the integer 3?". Hence I have decided to try out a lower level language (of which C is the currently standing one out of many others like Cobol, fortran and all) to understand the workings of higher level languages since they were also build upon lower level languages.
